## üõ†Ô∏è Testing the Application

```python
php artisan test
```
Note: When running tests (php artisan test),
 ensure you use MySQL as the database instead of SQLite.
 SQLite may return decimal values (e.g., 100) as numbers without decimal formatting,
 causing test failures when expecting strings like "100.00".
MySQL preserves decimal formatting (e.g., 100.00) due to the decimal(8, 2) data type,
making it more compatible with the test expectations in this project.


The repository includes a Postman Collection and a documentation file explaining the thought process and decisions made during the implementation.
